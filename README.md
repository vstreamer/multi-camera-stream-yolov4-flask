# Flask Video Streaming With YOLO v4 and Deep SORT for Live Customer Counting
Multiple live video streaming with people detection, tracking, and counting. Uses YOLO v4 as the pre-trained model for object detection and Deep SORT trained on the MARS dataset for object tracking. Each video stream uses ImageZMQ for asynchronous processing.

Project is not yet complete; README will be fully updated after completion.
