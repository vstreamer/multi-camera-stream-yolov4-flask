# Flask Video Streaming and Live Customer Counting with YOLOv3 and Deep SORT
Multiple live video streaming with people detection, tracking, and counting. Uses YOLOv3 as the pre-trained model for object detection and Deep SORT trained on the MARS dataset for object tracking. Each video stream uses ImageZMQ for asynchronous processing.

Project is not yet complete; README will be fully updated after completion.
